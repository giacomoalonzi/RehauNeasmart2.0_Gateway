We just implemented the feature described in the attached plan.

Please do a thorough code review:

1. Make sure that the plan was correctly implemented.
2. Look for any obvious bugs or issues in the code.
3. **Data Naming Convention Compliance**: Verify that all backend data (snake_case) is properly transformed to frontend format (camelCase) in API responses. Check for:
   - API responses transformed to camelCase before sending to clients
   - Request data properly handled in snake_case format
   - Consistent use of proper type hints for data transformation
   - Proper handling of nested objects and arrays
4. Look for subtle data alignment issues (e.g. expecting snake_case but getting camelCase or expecting data to come through in an object but receiving a nested object like {data:{}})
5. Look for any over-engineering or files getting too large and needing refactoring
6. Look for any weird syntax or style that doesn't match other parts of the codebase

Document your findings in docs/review/<N>\_FEATURE.md unless a different file name is specified.
